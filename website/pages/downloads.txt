**This program depends on a number of modules including the python, gtk and the python-gtk bindings.** Most linux distributions have standard packages for these bindings, if your distribution has these packages installing them will probably be much easier then compiling them manually .

In order to compile and install the source run:

'''
$ ./test.py
$ ./setup.py install
'''

More detailed instructions to build from source can be found [[install|here]].
